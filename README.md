# EASY 21

This is the implementation of the game and Monte Carlo and SARSA Policy Iteration algorithms
introduced in the [RL course by David Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).

Require Python 3.7.3 to run.

Run `python3 play_game.py` to play the game manually.
 
To try the RL algorithm, run `python3 play_game.py --ai` .

Run `python3 play_game.py --help` for more details.
